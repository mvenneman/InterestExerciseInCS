The same exercise (originally written in Java) now written in C#

### Write a program program that calculates Credit Card interest for a Person.

* Visa gets 10%
* MC gets 5% interest
* Discover gets 1% interest

Each Card Type can have multiple cards and there can be multiple Wallets for a Person.

NOTE: SIMPLE INTEREST for this test case (means 1 month of interest, if the interest rate is 10% and the amount is 100.00 â€“ interest in this case would be 10.00)

###### Here are the test Cases

1. 1 person has 1 wallet and 3 cards (1 Visa, 1 MC, 1 Discover)
  * Each Card has a balance of $100
  * calculate the total interest (simple interest) for this person and per card.

2. 1 person has 2 wallets
  * Wallet 1 has a Visa and Discover
  * Wallet 2 has a MC
  * Each card has $100 balance
  * Calculate the total interest(simple interest) for this person and interest per wallet

3. 2 people have 1 wallet each
  * Person 1 has 1 wallet with 3 cards (1 MC, 1 Visa, 1 Discover)
  * Person 2 has 1 wallet with 2 cards (1 Visa, 1 MC)
  * All cards in all wallets for both people have a $100 balance
  * Calculate the total interest(simple interest) for each person and interest per wallet
